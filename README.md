## 📈 Understanding Your Results

### Heart Rate
- **Normal:** 60-100 BPM (resting)
- **Bradycardia:** < 60 BPM (may be normal for athletes)
- **Tachycardia:** > 100 BPM (exercise, stress, or medical condition)

### HRV Metrics
- **RMSSD:** Higher values (>30ms) indicate better cardiovascular fitness
- **Stress Level:** Derived from multiple HRV parameters
- **LF/HF Ratio:** Balance between sympathetic/parasympathetic nervous systems

### ECG Intervals
- **PR Interval:** 120-200ms (normal conduction)
- **QRS Duration:** 80-120ms (ventricular conduction)
- **QT Interval:** Rate-corrected using Bazett's formula

### AI Classification (if enabled)
- **Normal (N):** Healthy heartbeats
- **Supraventricular (S):** Beats from above ventricles
- **Ventricular (V):** Beats from ventricles (may need attention)
- **Fusion (F):** Mixed morphology beats
- **Other (Q):** Unclassifiable or paced beats

**⚠️ Important:** This is not a diagnostic tool. AI classification features are currently experimental and under development. Results should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment decisions. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical interpretation.
